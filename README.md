# hello-world

Project repository 

- Students in IT 115 are going to add content to this project. 

- Hello, World! itself does really have to do very much. It's mostly just an excuse to make several directories of practice code we can practice managing projects on GitHub.
That being said, if you can add some fun features to the Game, please do!

Group 1 is the primary editor for this class-level repository for hello, world. If you would like to contribute please see [contributing.md](https://github.com/carlianderson/hello-world/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md
